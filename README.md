# My portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. It's available at [https://nathan-lemoine.be](https://nathan-lemoine.be).
It's in French, but I think translate it in English later.
This project was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).
I use [Vite js](https://vitejs.dev/) for the development server and the build.

I made the css without any framework. I should migrate to modules css.
